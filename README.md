# 🤖 LLM Sentiment Analysis: BERT Fine-Tuning

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project demonstrates the ability to effectively fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) of the Encoder type (BERT-based) to solve a classic NLP challenge: binary sentiment classification on movie reviews.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Architecture
* **Architecture:** BERT / DistilBERT (Encoder-Only Model)
* **Key Libraries:** Hugging Face `transformers`, `datasets`, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
* **Dataset:** IMDB Movie Reviews (50,000 film reviews)
* **Goal:** Achieve high F1-score and Accuracy on the test set.

## 📊 Results (Post Fine-tuning)
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Test Accuracy** | TBD |
| **Test F1-score** | TBD |
| **Confusion Matrix** | TBD (Image/Visualization) |
